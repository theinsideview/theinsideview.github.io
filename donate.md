You can donate money to support the youtube videos, podcast episodes and transcripts via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/theinsideview).

(There are also other benefits including early previews of videos, access to unreleased footage and more).

Here is a list of people who have generously supported the podcast before I even started patreon:
- Scott Alexander
- Alexey Malafeev
- Vincent Weisser

And these are the people who have contributed at least once to a tier above "The Inside Few" on patreon, aka the tier where you're part of the few people that are on this page:
- Ryan Coppolo
- Gunnar HÃ¶glund
- Vincent Weisser
- JJ Hepburn
