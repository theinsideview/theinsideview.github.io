Hi there. I'm [Michaël Trazzi](https://michaeltrazzi.com), your host for The Inside View podcast, and here's the first definition for what's an "inside view" on google:

> "Whereas the inside view attempts to make predictions based on an understanding of the details of a problem, the outside view—also called reference class forecasting—instead looks at similar past situations and predicts based on those outcomes."

The goal of this podcast is to create a place where people discuss their inside views about existential risk from AI.

For episodes about AI Alignment research I recommend [Collin Burns](https://theinsideview.ai/collin), [David Krueger](https://theinsideview.ai/david) and [Neel Nanda](https://theinsideview.ai/neel). For AI Governance I suggest my conversations with [Shahar Avin](https://theinsideview.ai/shahar), [Katja Grace](https://theinsideview.ai/katja) and [Holly Elmore](https://theinsideview.ai/holly).
