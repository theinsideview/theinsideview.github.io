        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>SB-1047 documents the unprecedented political battle that erupted when California introduced the first major AI safety bill. At its center stands Governor Gavin Newsom, caught between two powerful coalitions fighting for control over humanity's most transformative technology. On one side: State Senator Scott Wiener backed by AI safety researchers, Hollywood celebrities like Mark Ruffalo, and even Elon Musk. On the other: tech giants led by Mark Zuckerberg, venture capital powerhouse Marc Andreessen, and political heavyweight Nancy Pelosi. Through exclusive access to key players, this documentary reveals the high-stakes lobbying war that unfolded both online and within Sacramento's Capitol corridors—a conflict that would determine how we govern AI before it's too late.</p>
