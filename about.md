Hi there. I'm [Michaël Trazzi](https://michaeltrazzi.com), your host for The Inside View podcast, and here's the first definition for what's an "inside view" on google:

> "Whereas the inside view attempts to make predictions based on an understanding of the details of a problem, the outside view—also called reference class forecasting—instead looks at similar past situations and predicts based on those outcomes."

The goal of this podcast is to create a place where people discuss their inside views about existential risk from AI (including AI Alignment, AI Governance, AI timelines, and everything else that could be decision-relevant for thinking about existential risk from AI).

I started these interviews because I was having interesting conversations online and I thought it made sense to record them.

You could start with the popular episodes, namely [Connor Leahy](https://theinsideview.ai/connor2), [Ethan](https://theinsideview.ai/ethan2) [Caballero](https://theinsideview.ai/ethan) and [Robert Miles](https://theinsideview.ai/rob), the ones actually about AI Alignment research (especially [Collin Burns](https://theinsideview.ai/collin), [David Krueger](https://theinsideview.ai/david) and [Victoria Krakovna](https://theinsideview.ai/victoria)), the ones where we discuss AI Governance (with [Shahar Avin](https://theinsideview.ai/shahar), [Simeon Campos](https://theinsideview.ai/simeon) and [Katja Grace](https://theinsideview.ai/katja)) or the underappreciated ones (high like/dislike ratio on Youtube, but not a lot of views), aka [Alex Lawsen](https://theinsideview.ai/alex) and [Robert Long](https://theinsideview.ai/roblong).
