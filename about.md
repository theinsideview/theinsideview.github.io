Hi there. I'm [Michaël Trazzi](https://michaeltrazzi.com), your host for The Inside View podcast, and here's the first definition for what's an "inside view" on google:

> "Whereas the inside view attempts to make predictions based on an understanding of the details of a problem, the outside view—also called reference class forecasting—instead looks at similar past situations and predicts based on those outcomes."

The goal of this podcast is to create a place where people discuss their inside views about existential risk from AI.

For learn about AI Alignment research I recommend my episodes with [Evan Hubinger](https://theinsideview.ai/evan2); [Collin Burns](https://theinsideview.ai/collin), [David Krueger](https://theinsideview.ai/david) and [Neel Nanda](https://theinsideview.ai/neel). For AI Governance I suggest listening to [Holly Elmore](https://theinsideview.ai/holly), [Shahar Avin](https://theinsideview.ai/shahar) and [Katja Grace](https://theinsideview.ai/katja).

More recently, I have also started doing [paper walkthroughs](https://theinsideview.ai/walkthroughs) (I especially recommend the [full takeoff model series](https://theinsideview.ai/walkthroughs#ai-timelines)), animated video explainers (in particular [this video](https://theinsideview.ai/explainers#paul-christianos-views-on-ai-doom-ft-robert-miles) clarifying AI doom scenarios, and a [video adaptation](https://youtu.be/tpcA5T5QS30) of a short story.
